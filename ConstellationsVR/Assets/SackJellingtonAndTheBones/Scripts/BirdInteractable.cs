///PART OF SPHERE FIT BIRD
///Sphere Fit Bird is a collaboration between Dana Gretton (good at math) and
///Aubrey Simonson (his boyfriend, inventor) based on Aubrey's 2021 MIT Media Lab Thesis project, Bird.
///For more information on Bird, see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p6IUu9QIzWNBERz3IW_yVcojQjVz06rl/view?usp=sharing
///This project works with the OVR Toolkit, and once OpenXR is more stable, someone should probably make an OpenXR version.
///
/// BirdInteractable.cs goes on an object that bird can interact with.
/// This code is full of options for exactly how the object behaves, which is why it is so long.
/// No linear algebra was harmed in the creation of this script.
///
/// It requires Bird.cs on at least one hand.
///
/// //note here later for anything that needs connected
